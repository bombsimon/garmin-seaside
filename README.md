# Seaside

Seaside is an attempt at a minimalistic Garmin watch face. This is heavily
inspired by the watch mockup by [Commissioner Of
designâ„¢](https://dribbble.com/shots/4945320-Digital-Watch-face/) since I thought
it looked so nice. I'm still in the search of a better font and a better
implementation. The current fon't used is
[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) from Google. The font's has
been converted to bitmap fonts according to the [Resource
Compiler](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/programmers-guide/resource-compiler)
documentation, however the recommended application
([BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/)) is only available for
Windows and I'm still looking for a good (free) alternative for macOS.
